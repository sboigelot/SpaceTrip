		if order even possible
		
	first time tooltip is show, it is max size Y

Gameplay todo:
	
	Normal Space:
		done for now
		
	Wrap:

		1000 km/s rewards are ridiculus now
	
	Subspace: 
		When enter:
			new impact that give more life to astroids (better radar)
			allow search for palladium
			allow craft electronics
		half Subspace:

			massive upgrade for speed and all resources
		half subspace:
			allow infuse mana from pyralium
