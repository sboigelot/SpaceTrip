Bugs / refinement:
	
	on load game, all asteroid spawn in a row

	add obsoleted_by_purchase in shop upgrade to disable normal laser upgrade if not bougth before ble laser?
		if order even possible
		
	first time tooltip is show, it is max size Y
	
	(Should be fixed): on other screen resolution game space is not aligned (issue with asteroids spawns)

Gameplay todo:
	
	Normal Space:
		done for now
		
	Wrap:
		done for now
	
	Subspace: 
			mine palladium mission reward is copy of first mission
			plate refining next 10M -> 5M 
			auto hydro I
			auto liquid next
			refinery speed boost next
			(large asteroid chance, scale ++, mining ++)
			
		half Subspace: 
			allow craft electronics
			green laser upgrade (clear ray and create new ones)
		
		
	purchase "Enter Hyperspace" -> acc x 1000 -> require electronics (from palladium)

	Hyperspace:
		When enter:
			all search for pyralium
			massive upgrade for speed and all resources
		half subspace:
			allow infuse mana from pyralium

	Outro: end animation reach planet

	maybe use slow version of grim music
	add sfx

	add achievements? (take wake cup achievemnt layer)

	end game unlock speed multiplier purchase + speed button (work like boost engine: boost speed)

	time in a bottle increase when not playing, can be used to speed up time while playing?
